A phpBB3 theme for the ScummVM forums, based on the default prosilver theme

To create this theme:
- Copy all of the files from the styles/prosilver folder inside a new folder,
  style/scummvm
- Remove all of the html files inside styles/scummvm/template
  This is done to keep the scummvm theme easily in sync with any updates or
  additions to the prosilver theme. Check here for more info:

- Replace all of the files in the new styles/scummvm folder with the ones
  inside this directory
- You can now select this theme inside the admin control panel

The 3 preview images are not part of the theme, they are just here to easily
monitor progress.
